              <p>This is a first attempt at a portfolio for the UT Full Stack coding Bootcamp. This website only utilizies HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
                The goal was to replicate another website design by the class. This portfolio will eventually be dynamic and utilize both front-end and 
                back-end technology. Please visit the portfolio page to see other projects I have worked on. Currently, my Contact page is underconstruction. 
                Please visit my linkedin if you would like to contact me.</p>
              <p>I recently moved to Austin but I've lived in the Austin area for the past 8 years. I have two kitties,
                Calcifer and Sofie, named after characters from one of my favorite movies, Howl's Moving Castle. I try to
                spend as much time outside as my laziness will allow. I like to hunt for mushrooms or nice little shady
                spots to read and draw. I also really enjoy playing D&D and video games. I'm just a lady trying to further her education since I'm not doing a damn thing with my
                Psycology degree. I've worked in IT adjacent jobs for the past few years and I'm ready to actually do some
                real creative computer work!</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
